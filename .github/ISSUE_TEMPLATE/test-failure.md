# :beetle: Test failure
> Test failures can be caused by incorrect output formatting, logic errors, or runtime errors. They are more difficult to find and fix than syntax/style errors. But if you follow the directions in each section below, you should be able to pinpoint the bug. Once you think you've found the issue, update your program and resubmit (commit/push). You may need to repeat this cycle several times. :repeat:

> [This video](https://youtu.be/gdc-SYhRFCM) illustrates how I use GitHub and Repl.it to debug a programming assignment.

### :printer: Output formatting
1. Open the [assignment directions](../blob/main/README.md) here in GitHub, and find the **output requirements**.
2. In another browser tab, open your program in repl.it by clicking the **work in replit** button.
3. Run your program in repl.it
4. Compare the format of your console output to the output format required in the directions. 
5. Do they match **EXACTLY**? The capitalization, punctuation, whitespace, and formatting must match exactly.
### :arrow_forward: Manually run the test cases
1. Open the assignment in [Canvas](https://uvu.instructure.com/), and find the **test cases** listed in the rubric. 
2. In another browser tab, Open your program in repl.it by clicking the **work in replit** button in the [assignment directions](../blob/main/README.md).
4. With both replit and the rubric open, run your program with each set of inputs listed in the rubric's test cases.
5. Compare your output in the console to the test case's output. The values should match exactly.
### :mag_right: Re-read the directions
- Open the [assignment directions](../blob/main/README.md) and re-read them very closely several times. Did you miss any small details?
### :footprints: Step through your program with Pythontutor
- Copy your code, paste it into the [this text box](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit), then click **Visualize Execution**.
- Step through execution of each line of code by pressing the **next** button beneath your code.
- Watch exactly what is happening in memory at each step. This will allow you quickly identify and fix logic errors.
### :writing_hand: Re-write your algorithm from scratch
- Don't start with the code, start with your algorithm.

### :open_book: Inspect the test log below
- Are there any clues that are helpful?
